## About The Project
**We are a team that met in the program called "Game Entrepreneurs" supported by a ministry of the Republic of Turkey.** Our team consists of 4 people for now. Our purpose to develop the game are as follows:

* To determine our limits and strengths,  
* To understand the scrump methodology,  
* To strengthen the communication,  
* To determine our most suitable working system.  

We developed the game in 2 weeks, then debugged and revised in 1 week.
What we did from the idea stage of the game to its release:

* We brainstormed on the Miro.  
* We created userstories and scored each story with scrum poker.  
* We help meetings for 10 minutes each morning. In these meetings, we shared what to do on a daily and talked about if there was a problem.  
* We have prepared cards for each to be done on Trello. We have created categories called to-do, development phase, testing phase, completed and canceled.  
* We help weekly sprint meetings and talked about what we did last week. We discussed how we can solve it if there is a problem and what we can do to improve our performance next week. We conducted a survey and discussed results to evaluate own performance and team.
